#  **Random Password Generator**

This is the completed third weekly challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding Bootcamp.
The project required us to take an existing index.html with a correspong style.css and create a script.js that would run the asked for program.  Namely, the JS(Javascript) code we were asked to write, required us to prompt the user about a number of criteria:
**(required)**
    1. How long the user wished the pw(password) to be.
        - the pw must be between 8 and 128 chracters long.
**(Optional- but the user must pick at least one of the following option)**
    2. If the user wished to include lowercase letters (a-z).
    3. If the user wished to include uppercase letters (A-Z).
    4. If the user wished to include numers (0-9).
    5. If the user wished to include special characters (!,@,#,$,%,^,",&,*, etc.)
The preceding criteria are then used to generate a random password.

## **Motivation**

This was a very difficult challenge.  It helped reinforce some very- for me at least- hard-to-grasp concepts.  These included:
- learning introductory JS.
- Gaining a better understanding of JS syntax and structure
- Learning about and implementing:
    - object methods
    - Functions
    - User input
    - Loop syntax
    - The list goes on and on.

  

## **Build Status**

For the pruposes of this weekly challenge this build should be considered complete barring any mistakes or omissions by me.  

## **Code Style**

This project came preloaded with basic HTML and CSS.  We were required to write Javascript to complete all the project criteria.
